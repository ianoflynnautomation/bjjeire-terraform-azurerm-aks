# tls_private_key / RSA private key stored in Terraform state
# The SSH key-pair is generated here intentionally. The private
# key is immediately written to Azure Key Vault (kv_secret_values)
# and is never exposed outside of the deployment pipeline.

# AKS: API server authorized IP ranges
# Configured by the module consumer via
# var.aks_api_server_authorized_ip_ranges. Trivy cannot resolve
# variable values at static-analysis time so it treats the field
# as unset. The caller is responsible for restricting access.

# AKS: RBAC not enabled
# Controlled by var.aks_role_based_access_control_enabled.
# Trivy cannot resolve variable values at static-analysis time.

# AKS: Network policy not configured
# Controlled by var.aks_network_policy. Trivy cannot resolve
# variable values at static-analysis time.

# Key Vault: soft_delete_retention_days / purge protection
# Trivy scans the upstream AVM key vault module source
# (terraform-azurerm-avm-res-keyvault-vault) and flags this
# because the variable has no default. The value is supplied
# by the caller via var.kv_soft_delete_retention_days and
# var.kv_purge_protection_enabled in main.tf.
